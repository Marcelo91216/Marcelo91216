I'm am perfectionist person, I like and want things to work correctly as planned, and is something that I like to demostrate with my own proyects that I worked on my school here in Mexico. 
I came here to express not only the ideas that I have been thinking since the last 3 years new ideas every time I have known new topics about my career, for example AIs, algorithms, mathematics, cybersecurity, networking, videogames, IoT and much more new topics.

I have planned from now on to start trying to get some reputation around these career and gain some new experience finally in a real job. Becuase I have the dream of setting up my own tiny company of software development. ¿Development of what? Of every kind of software in general, but also getting more focus in videogames, desktop and mobile aplications, IoT and Web.

## My values
###My values consist on:
####- Team work
####- Quality
####- Endeavor
####- Persistance

## Interesting topics for me
The ideas that I have been thinking to start new projects are:
- A new lexer that converts C++ codes into Flow Diagramas, as an extension of Visual Studio Code.
- Know more about algorithms applied to AIs.
- Create my own web page in Angular as a blog.
- Found my own company with the purpose of helping other people and companies.
- A fighting videogame involving origami as the main topic.
- A new programming language for my last semester.
- Try to design and build my own operative system, and upload it in a virtual machine for testing it.

## My Achievements
All my achievements during academic time consist on:
- A [concurrent Lexer Scanner](https://github.com/Marcelo91216/Implementacion-reto-con-go-lexer-concurrente.git) for Python codes made in Go. It converts the Python code from input and creates an HTML5 and CSS3 code that highlights the sintax of a Python code, in a concurrent way that each input is processed separately.

- A [desktop aplication for GuillCast company](https://github.com/Marcelo91216/ProgramaDeGuillCast.git) made in Python consisting in a inventory of strips, this software was made to help the GuillCast company director to manage in a better way the count of strips they produce by automatizing this task using Python with the library [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/es/3/library/tkinter.html) and [Openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

- A [plataformer videogame](https://marcelo91216.itch.io/little-man-adventure-web-version?secret=Ifa1PVyYlTtPJZBmjjakPa5uRys) made in the game engine Unity, this one doesn't come from a class, ratherless from my own ideas to make during summer 2022.

- A [management program made for the Wellness Center](https://github.com/5100-chap/Wellness-SRAD.git), a place of my own school for sport clases. This software was created with the purpose of helping automatizing some tasks that the administrators were tired by doing manually.

- A [quality testing program](https://github.com/Marcelo91216/Wellness-srad-calidad.git) made with the framework Selenium in the IDE Aqua JetBrains, consisting in quality tests to ensure the correct working for a software, in this case this was proven on a web page made for the Wellness Center here in Tecnológico de Monterrey.

- A [software to help bring clases to external people from Tecnológico de Monterrey](https://github.com/ongorio/TC2007Bserver.git), this was made in a web page using Node JS with Sequelize to manage better the database instructions, also was made a Front-End made in Swift exclusive for iOS mobile, but my principal effort was in the server side.

- A [scanner of transmission codes that find for malicious code](https://github.com/Marcelo91216/llamadoActInt1.git), made for the class of advanced algorithms, it scans the texts that are transmissions with malicious data in them, the purpose of the program is to find them and count the possible other malicious data.

## My gained skills
I have gained during all this experience many lessons, topics, ideas and new doors that were opened for me to new oportunities that I can reach with my previews knowledges.
