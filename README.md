I came here to express not only the ideas that I have been thinking since the last 3 years new ideas every time I have known new topics about my career, for example AIs, algorithms, mathematics, cybersecurity, networking, videogames, IoT and much more new topics.

## My Values
My values consist on:
- Team work
- Quality
- Endeavor
- Persistance

## Interesting topics for me
The ideas that I have been thinking to start new projects are:
- A new lexer that converts C++ codes into Flow Diagramas, as an extension of Visual Studio Code.
- Know more about algorithms applied to AIs.
- Create my own web page in Angular as a blog.
- Found my own company with the purpose of helping other people and companies.
- A fighting videogame involving origami as the main topic
- A new programming language for my last semester

## My Achievements
All my achievements during academic time consist on:
- A [concurrent Lexer Scanner](https://github.com/Marcelo91216/Implementacion-reto-con-go-lexer-concurrente.git) for Python codes made in Go.

- A [desktop aplication for GuillCast company](https://github.com/Marcelo91216/ProgramaDeGuillCast.git) made in Python consisting in a inventory of strips.

- A [plataformer videogame](https://marcelo91216.itch.io/little-man-adventure-web-version?secret=Ifa1PVyYlTtPJZBmjjakPa5uRys) made in the game engine Unity.

- A [management program](https://github.com/5100-chap/Wellness-SRAD.git) made for the Wellness Center, a place of my own school for sport clases. This software was created with the purpose of helping automatizing some tasks that the administrators were tired by doing manually.

- A [quality testing program](https://github.com/Marcelo91216/Wellness-srad-calidad.git) made with the framework Selenium in the IDE Aqua JetBrains, consisting in quality tests to ensure the correct working for a software, in this case this was proven on a web page made for the Wellness Center here in Tecnológico de Monterrey.

- A [software to help bring clases to external people from Tecnológico de Monterrey](https://github.com/ongorio/TC2007Bserver.git), this was made in a web page using Node JS with Sequelize to manage better the database instructions, also was made a Front-End made in Swift exclusive for iOS mobile, but my principal effort was in the server side.

## My gained skills
I have gained during all this experience many lessons, topics, ideas and new doors that were opened for me to new oportunities that I can reach with my previews knowledges.
